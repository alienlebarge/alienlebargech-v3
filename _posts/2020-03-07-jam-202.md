<p>I recently get the <a href="https://www.qubitelectronix.com/shop/bloom">Qu-bit Bloom sequencer</a>. This sequencer is an instant melody maker. I wanted to test is in a live situation. All the melodies in this jam are sequenced by the Bloom except part when BIA is used.</p>
<p>When searching for examples of what you can do with it, I only found ambient stuff. So if you wanted some techno done with the Bloom, here you are.</p>
<p>And yes, this module is amazing !</p>
