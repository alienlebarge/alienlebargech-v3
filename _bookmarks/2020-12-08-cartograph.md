> Cartograph is a handsome monospaced font family featuring lush italics, code-friendly ligatures, and a proportional set accessible via OpenType. With warmth and character to spare, Cartograph excels in both code and prose.

I really like monospace fonts with nice italics.
In addition, the price of the license is very reasonable.
