[In the latest episode of the AppStories podcast](https://appstories.net/episodes/412), @robb@social.lol mentioned that he uses [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app) to manage his RSS feeds. I had never heard of this service before.

Miniflux is a minimalistic and opinionated feed reader. You can choose to host on your server or pay for a hosted version ($15/year).

I currently use [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) as a basic RSS feed reader. I don't take advantage of all its highlighting, sorting, and AI features. I think it might be a bit expensive for reading RSS feeds.

I'm going to give Miniflux a try for a while to see if it's a good fit for me and if it can replace Readwise Reader. I was impressed with how fast Miniflux was right from the start.

We'll see how it goes.
