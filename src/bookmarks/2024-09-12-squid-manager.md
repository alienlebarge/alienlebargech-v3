The [Squid Sampler](https://busycircuits.com/alm022/) is one of my oldest Eurorack modules. Not everyone likes it, but I adore it. It previously lacked a straightforward way to create sound banks for the Squid from a computer. Now, thanks to Chris, who developed an app, this is possible and much more.
