I am a noob in terms of microphones. I'm currently looking for one for sampling sounds. The *MC4* by *Line Audio* looks like a really good one at a descent price.

If you have any recommendations please share.

> This little microphone has a natural, detailed and balanced response. Perfect for natural reproduction of acoustical instruments such as members of the bowed and plucked string-families, grand piano, brass, percussion, overhead choir and voice with a minimum of colouration.
