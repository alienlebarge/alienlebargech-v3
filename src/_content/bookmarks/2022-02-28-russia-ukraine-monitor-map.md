You have to be careful with the information you see online. Everything is not always true.

Here is an interesting card that lists the verified information and a description of the verification process.

> The [Russia-Ukraine Monitor Map](https://maphub.net/Cen4infoRes/russian-ukraine-monitor) is a crowdsourced effort by [Centre for Information Resilience](https://www.info-res.org/) (CIR) and the wider open source community to map, document and verify significant incidents during the conflict in Ukraine. Its aim is to provide reliable information for policymakers, journalists as well as justice and accountability bodies about the evolving situations both on-the-ground and online.
