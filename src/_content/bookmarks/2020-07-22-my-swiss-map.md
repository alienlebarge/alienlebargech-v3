Are you planning a hike or bike tour soon? Do you want to immortalize your favorite place? Are you looking for an unusual gift?

The Swiss Confederation's topography office allows you to print your own map. Choose a scale, center point, cover photo and title and receive your personalized map.

The service is really nice. Too bad we can't (yet) choose the layer to appear on the map, such as hiking paths.
