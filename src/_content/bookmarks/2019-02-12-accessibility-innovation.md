&gt; In a perfect world, we shouldn’t need accessibility meetups. In a perfect world accessibility would be embedded in the way we design and develop products; the way we make content; the way we think and talk about the spaces we live in. It wouldn’t be a separate topic, but part of everything we do.

&gt; By its very definition, accessibility removes barriers. It frees us from constraints and gives us new, better, more resilient ways to interact with the world.
