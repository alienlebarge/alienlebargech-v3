I really like the idea of having an app for just you and your closest friends/family â€“ no strangers or advertisers allowed. A range of features encourages you to share intimate moments that make you feel connected.
My whole family uses WhatsApp which is an application that I would like to use as little as possible.
But before using Cocoon, I will wait and see what kind of data privacy we have, if the data are encrypted, if we can we export the data, etc.
