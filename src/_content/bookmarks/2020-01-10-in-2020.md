A wonderful article by [@aral](https://mastodon.ar.al/@aral)

> What we need is the opposite of Big Tech. We need Small Tech – everyday tools for everyday people designed to increase human welfare, not corporate profits.

> This is not some tin-foil hat conspiracy theory, it’s simply the business model of mainstream technology. I call this business model people farming.
