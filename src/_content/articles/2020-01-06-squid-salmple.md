Dear [Squid Salmple](https://busycircuits.com/alm022/) owners, I'm a happy owner of this octopus too and wonder how you trigger it .

This module is a beast and I love it. I write this post to tell you how I use it and have feedback about how **you** use it.
- Do you use all eight channels ? 
- Do you have special ninja tricks ?

## How I use it (most of the time)

I'm mainly interested in how you trigger it but I will give you some information how I modulate it too.

### Type of sample per channel

I tend to have a channel configuration like this:
- channel 1 host a bass drum 
- channel 2 is for snares
- channel 3 for hats
- channel 5 alternate drum sound
- channel 6, 7 and 8 synth sound, voice or effects that can be pitched shifted 

### Triggering

Channels 1 to 3 are triggered with [Grids](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/).
Because I do techno stuff, channel 1 is triggered by a [Varigate 8+](https://malekkoheavyindustry.com/product/varigate-8/) to have a 4x4 beat. There's simple a [passive mult](https://4mscompany.com/p.php?p=962&c=11) between the Grids and the Varigate 8+. One of the two sequencers is muted depending on the type of beats I want.

Channels 4 to 8 are triggered by the Varigate 8+. I edit them live during the performance.

#### Future technic

I really like creating patterns by turning knobs like with Grids. It's ultra fast and 99% of the time, it sounds good.\
Varigate 8+ is not so good for improvising. I find this not being ideal. Mistakes are easily done by pressing the wrong button and it's not so immediate. 

After seeing [Molten Modular video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk3uTIG0Fw8) of the [Bastl Kompas](https://bastl-instruments.com/eurorack/modules/kompas), I ordered one. I'm just waiting to receive and build it. It will add three more triggers at a low cost.

My idea is to trigger channels 1 to 3 with Grids (and Varigate for channel 1) and 4 to 6 with Kompas.
We will see how Grids and Kompas's patterns will work together.

### V/oct

I tend to use the [Voltage Block](https://malekkoheavyindustry.com/product/voltage-block/) v/oct to modulate v/oct on channel 6, 7 and 8.

### CV modulation

I have to dig more on that. The only thing I like to do now is modulating the rate and the speed of the kick drum.
I have not used cue position, for example. This is on my to-do list.

## About you

Please, tell me what is your workflow with the Squid. I'm certainly not the only one interested.
