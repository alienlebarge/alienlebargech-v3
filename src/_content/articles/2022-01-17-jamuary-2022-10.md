My iPhone hasn't record the video of this jam. This is why, you only get the sound. Sorry for that.

Here's you have the reason why I love [Triptych](http://www.steadystatefate.com/triptych) so much. This is one of my favorite modules of 2021. It's so intense and send you in an instant rave. This module is a beast.

[TÅ¡-L](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/tsl/) square wave is going into Triptych. Two envelopes from [Quadrax](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/quadrax/) are modulating the cutoff and VCA of Triptych. The melody is sequenced by [meloDICER](https://www.vermona.com/en/products/modules/product/melodicer/) and [Voltage Block](https://malekkoheavyindustry.com/product/voltage-block/) and the drums by [Droid](https://shop.dermannmitdermaschine.de/pages/droid-universal-cv-processor).
