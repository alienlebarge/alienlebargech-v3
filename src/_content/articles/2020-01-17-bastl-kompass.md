I was looking for some trigger generator to trigger the Squid Salmple. I already own the Grids wich I love.
The Grids trigger the first three channels of the Squid Sample. Now, the [Kompas](https://bastl-instruments.com/eurorack/modules/kompas) trigger four, five and six.

## The build

The DIY Kit was orderd from on [Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/).
It's a very easy build. There's no difficulties. You even get some welding wire which was much better than mine.

The only problems I run into:

1. The first one was my fault. I haven't well measure the resistors and switched the 10k and 1M ones. I managed to get out of it and correct the problem. It was the first time that I had to unsolder resistors. I have succeeded and I am quite proud as I am a total beginner.\
So make sure to identify correctly the resistors.
2. When soldering the the 10K and 100K resistors on the bottom parts, the assembly guide is not very clear which one goes where. I had to look at the [schematics](https://github.com/stziopa/kompas/tree/master/Schematics) to figure what was the right position the 10K and 100K. Here are the positions:
    - R1: 100K
    - R4: 100K
    - R5: 100K
    - R6: 100K
    - R13: 100K
    - R16: 100K
    - R18: 10k
    - R20: 10K
    - R22: 10K
3. The male header were missing so I have to order some. (And wait two days until I get them. It was looong.)

Other than that, everything went very well. It's an easy build. Well done Bastl !
