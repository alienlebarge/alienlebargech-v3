When playing live on my modular synth, my drums (specially the snare and hats) are sequenced by two modules: 

- [Mutable Instruments Grids](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/) and 
- [VPME Euclidean Circles v2](https://vpme.de/euclidean-circles/). 

I’m looking for a kind of switch or technique to crossfade from a sequencer to another. The ideal module for that would be the [Confundo Funkitus](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/noise-engineering-confundo-funkitus-). Unfortunately, This Module is discontinued.

Do you have an idea to achieve that ?

For the time being my options are:

- [Doepfer A-182-2 Quad Switches](https://www.doepfer.de/a1822.htm)
- [Instruo tàin](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/tain/)
- [Acid Rain Technology Switchblade](https://web.archive.org/web/20201001190807/https://acidraintechnology.com/products/switchblade)
- etc.
