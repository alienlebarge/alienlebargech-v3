This is more a jam to test the [Doepfer A-197-3](http://www.doepfer.de/a1973.htm) [I received today](https://alienlebarge.ch/photos/2021/01/bn4z3/).

This thing is fun !

I do not use an external power. The power used in the rack where the A-197-3 sits is a TipTop uZeus.
This is the led stripe you get with the module and set the colors like so:

- red is <abbr title="volt per octave">v/oct</abbr>
- green is the gate that triggers the bass drum
- blue is a random step voltage that changes every 32 bars
