Here is an abstract performance where I'm playing by hand [Blades](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/blades/) exploring what sounds it can do. This module shines when you patch it with itself. You can get weird waves and glitchy noises.
[Beads](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/beads/) add some reverb and some kind of rhythm by generating grains at a constant rate.
