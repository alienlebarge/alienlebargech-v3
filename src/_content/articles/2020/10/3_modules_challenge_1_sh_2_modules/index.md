Here's a new 3 module challenge from [@DivKid](https://www.twitter.com/DivKid)'s Patreon community.

In this patch, I used [Mimeophon](https://makenoisemusic.com/modules/mimeophon), [RND Steps](https://divkidvideo.com/rnd-step-the-third-divkid-eurorack-module/) and [Ã¸chd](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/ochd/).

Very nice sounds are generated in this patch. It's definitely something to sample and use of.
