[Castor & Pollux](https://winterbloom.com/shop/castor-and-pollux) is in action in this patch. Each oscillators are hard panned one on each side and sequenced by one of [Metropolix](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/metropolix/)'s tracks. The lead sounds goes then through [Blades](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/blades/), [Veils](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/veils/) and finally [Melotus Versio](https://noiseengineering.us/products/melotus-versio).

Drums are sequenced by [a custom patch](https://github.com/alienlebarge/droid-32sek) for [Droid](https://shop.dermannmitdermaschine.de/pages/droid-universal-cv-processor). [Prok](https://prok.co.uk/) are buffed up by [Autodyne](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/steady-state-fate-autodyne).

There's some action of [321](https://frap.tools/products/321/), [333](https://frap.tools/products/333/) and [RND Step](https://divkidvideo.com/rnd-step-the-third-divkid-eurorack-module/) to add some variation in the patch.
