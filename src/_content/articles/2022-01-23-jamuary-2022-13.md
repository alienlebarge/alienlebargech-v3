[Mutables instruments](https://mutable-instruments.net/) is one of my favorite eurorack module brands. The work and reflection that Emilie Gillet puts into these modules is just incredible. 

In this patch, I tried to use the three voices of these modules which are [Plaits](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/plaits/), [Beads](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/beads/) and [Rings](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/rings/) in order to create a melody. [Compare 2](https://joranalogue.com/products/compare-2) allows you to generate events based on the 1v/oct received by Beads and Rings. This allows Plaits to receive a mix of both 1v/oct via a switch. 

I hope you enjoy. I find it very relaxing.
