This little config will tell iTerm to open split windows in the current
directory. No more need to <kbd>cd</kbd> to your working directory when hitting <kbd>CMD</kbd> and <kbd>d</kbd>.

1. Go to *Preferences*
1. Select the *Profiles* tab
1. Select the *General* tab
1. In the *Working Directory* section check the *Advanced Configuration* option and click the *Edit…* button
1. In the *Working Directory for New Split Panes* check the *Reuse previous session’s directory* option

And voilà !
I hope it will save as much time for you as it as for me.
