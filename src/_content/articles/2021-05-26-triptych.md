A soon as [Triptych](http://www.steadystatefate.com/triptych) was announced, I knew that it will be in my arsenal. 
This module is born from a collaboration between [@SteadyStateFate](https://twitter.com/SteadyStateFate) and [@BiiElectronics](https://twitter.com/BiiElectronics) (aka [@boysnoize](https://twitter.com/boysnoize) and [@basek](https://twitter.com/baseck)). You can only expect an awesome module from them. I'm not disappointed.

It arrived, I plugged it et here is how you can destroy a simple square wave with it. Rave mode on !

Now, I am going to read the manual.
