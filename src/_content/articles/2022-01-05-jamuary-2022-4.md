Recently [I got modules from Takaab](https://alienlebarge.ch/photos/2021/12/4h65c/). They are simple but really well thought utilities (and really cheap if you exclude customs taxes). I was really impressed: their _2 LPG v2_ sounds really good.

In this patch, I use it with the _4ms Ensemble Oscillator_. I switch manually between the different tones available on the LPGs. Then, it runs through _Melotus Versio_.
Drums are sequenced by the lovely _Grids_.
