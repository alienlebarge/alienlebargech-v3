I have a serious delay this year! But that's life. There are things that cannot wait.

[Joranalogue's Compare 2](https://joranalogue.com/products/compare-2) is a module that I have to learn to use. It allows you to find magical paths to the groove (it doesn't mean anything). The resulting triggers can be slightly (or a lot) shifted and this leads to swing rhythms, results which are not square, which are not placed on a grid. And it's very refreshing.
