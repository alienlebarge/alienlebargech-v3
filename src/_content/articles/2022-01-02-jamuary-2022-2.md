This patch is all about exploration.

I used Beads as a sound source and from there I build something with all the Mutable Instruments of my system except Rings and Branches.  Blades, Stages, Plaits, Veils and Links were used to explore some kind of bubbly sounds. Beads is sequenced by meloDICER and I used Data Bender at the end of the chain.
