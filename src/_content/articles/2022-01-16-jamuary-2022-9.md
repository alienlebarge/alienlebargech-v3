A jam done in the rush after a long day skiing. I wasn't much inspired for this ne. I come over this strange techno set were [Rings](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/rings/) is use as a resonator for [Beads](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/beads/).
[Compare 2](https://joranalogue.com/products/compare-2) is used to triggers some event based on the two 1v/oct of Beads and Rings

Meoldies are sequenced my [Metropolix](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/metropolix/) and Drums by [Droid](https://shop.dermannmitdermaschine.de/pages/droid-universal-cv-processor).
