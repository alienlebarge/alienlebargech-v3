Haaa design systems !
I was waiting for this talk. As we start thinking about building [a design system for the State of Vaud](https://github.com/DSI-VD/foehn "Foehn, the design system for the State of Vaud on  GitHub"), my ears were wide open to grab information how to build design systems that works.

[Jina Bolton](https://web.archive.org/web/20151109004636/https://twitter.com/jina) works as a Senior Designer on the Design Systems team at Salesforce UX, working on the Lightning Design System and team evangelism.

So here are my notes about her interesting talk.
