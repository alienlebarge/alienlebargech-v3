<p>Hope you had a great New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>
  For the new year let's try some jams during the month of "Jamuary". 
  <br />
  I have never done that but we will see. I have set an alarm do one session each day. I'm sure I will not manage to post one every day. (We are the second day and I have already missed the first one...) 
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  The jams can be 5 seconds or an hour long, musical or total noise, it doesn't matter. The goal is to **explore**. 
  <br />
</p>
<p>
So here's the first one ... enjoy.</p>
