Hope you had a great New Year's Eve.

For the new year let's try some jams during the month of "Jamuary".  
I have never done that but we will see. I have set an alarm do one session each day. I'm sure I will not manage to post one every day. (We are the second day and I have already missed the first one...) 

The jams can be 5 seconds or an hour long, musical or total noise, it doesn't matter. The goal is to **explore**. 

So here's the first one ... enjoy.
