The meloDICER had no working LED. A new one arrived today. After days not having it in my rack, I was happy to play with it again.

In this Jam, my main voice is the Ts-L from Instruo. I use 3 outputs of it:

- Fold
- Sin
- Square

Each output was going through Veils.
The gate output of the meloDICER is triggering the envelope of the Fold. I duplicate the gate into the RND STEP who was triggering an envelope for the Sin and another one for the Square wave.

BIA through Viol Ruina for the saturated kick.
