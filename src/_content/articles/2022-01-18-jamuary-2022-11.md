I was frustrated about not having the video of [yesterday's jam](https://alienlebarge.ch/2022/01/jamuary-2022-10/).So I have kept the patch for this evening. But this time it was my Tascam recorder that runs out of batteries about 10 min in the jam.

I should have called this session "the cursed jam".
Despite this, I hope you enjoy the sound.
