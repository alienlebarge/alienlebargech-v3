Ten years ago, I bought a [Karl trekking pants from Fjällraven](https://www.fjallraven.com/eu/en-gb/men/trousers/outdoor-trousers/karl-pro-trousers-m). I never heard of this Swedish brand before but the pants were cool and the price OK.

Now I can say that this piece of equipment is awesome. It has gone through all my trekking and outdoor adventures with the family in the sun and in the snow.

A few days ago, the seams have come loose for the first time (they still have any holes). Of course, I will repair them. But I decided it was the signal to buy new trekking trousers and a winter jacket from Fjällraven. I went for the [Vidda Pro Ventilated](https://www.fjallraven.com/eu/en-gb/men/trousers/trekking-trousers/vidda-pro-ventilated-trs-m-reg?v=F81160R%3a%3a7323450725020)and the [Greenland Winter Jacket](https://www.fjallraven.com/eu/en-gb/men/jackets/winter-jackets/greenland-winter-jacket-m?v=F87122%3a%3a7323450728670).

As winter and cold weather are coming, it’s time to wax them. This is something I find relaxing et very efficient. The purpose of this is to enhance fabric’s wind and water resistance properties.

I hope I will use them for the next 10 years.
I am confident because the material used the G-1000 is the most resistant fabric that I have been able to test.
