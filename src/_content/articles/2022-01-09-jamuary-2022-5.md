This is the fifth jam of jamuary. I already missed four jams. I wasn't able to commit to some sessions due to family life and the booster. Last Thursday, I got my third dose of Moderna, felt bad for the two following days and had no energy to do the jams.This jams use intensively switched to send Akemie's Taiko sound to four different effects: Data Bender, Melotus Versio, Mimeophon and Beads. The result is quite interesting, I must use this technique more often.
