Oh yeah ! I love shaking bottles of waters on top of my system ;-)

The three modules in used are: 

## Instruo - arbhar

Which is sampling me shaking a bottle of water, generating grains of it and clocking Bloom. All sounds coming out of arbhar are feeding Rings <samp>In</samp> input.

## Qu-Bit Electronix - Bloom

Is triggering and sequencing arbhar and Rings.

## Mutable Instruments - Rings

Is used as a resonator with arbhar's input and Bloom sequencing.
