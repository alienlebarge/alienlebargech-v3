Wavetables is a territory I have never visited. I loaded some wavetable in the Squid Sample and played with them. There's some nice things to explore there. I have only scratch the surface for now.

The kick comes from the BIA (classssic!) and I tried to build some kind of hats sounds from the Ts-L through the Crush Delay v3.
