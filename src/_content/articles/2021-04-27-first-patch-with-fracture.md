[Fracture](https://wmdevices.com/products/fracture) was on my list since a long time. I am an absolute fan of these quircky sounds. Finally, [I manage to get one at a good price](https://alienlebarge.ch/photos/2021/04/as0at/).

Here is the first patch I made with it. The module is mainly modulated by hands to test how (cool) it sounds.
