[Fracture](https://wmdevices.com/products/fracture) was on my list since a long time. I am an absolute fan of these quircky sounds. Finally, [I manage to get one at a good price](https://alienlebarge.ch/photos/2021/04/as0at/).

Here is the first patch I made with it. The module is mainly modulated by hands to test how (cool) it sounds.

Fracture makes bottle and weird clap sounds, Prok BD is the kick. They are both sequenced by Euclidean Circles v2.
The meloDICER and Blades are in charge of the melody.
