I have to admit, I didn't have much inspiration for that one. I really like manipulating voices. Why not use the two Instruo samplers to manipulate film punchlines? In addition to [arbhar](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/arbhar/) and [Lubadh](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/lubadh/), there is some help from [Quadratt](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/1u/quadratt-1u/) and [Ã¸chd](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/ochd/) in the patch.
