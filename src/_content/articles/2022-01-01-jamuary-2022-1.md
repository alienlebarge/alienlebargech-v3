Yeah, this is Jamuary !

Like last year, I will try to post a jam (almost) every day.

Let's start with this one. The main sound comes from the BIA which is processed by SSF Tryptich. A copy of this is sent to Rings for some high pitch melodies.
Melodies are sequenced by Metropolix and drums by Euclidean Circle V2 and Grids.
