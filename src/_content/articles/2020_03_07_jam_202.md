I recently get the [Qu-bit Bloom sequencer](https://www.qubitelectronix.com/shop/bloom). This sequencer is an instant melody maker. I wanted to test is in a live situation. All the melodies in this jam are sequenced by the Bloom except part when BIA is used.

When searching for examples of what you can do with it, I only found ambient stuff. So if you wanted some techno done with the Bloom, here you are.
And yes, this module is amazing !

This jam is available [on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/34559209).
