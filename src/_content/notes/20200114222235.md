So sad, I won't be able to play with the [@bastlinstrument](https://twitter.com/bastlinstrument) [Kompass](https://bastl-instruments.com/eurorack/modules/kompas) I received from [@thonk](https://twitter.com/bastlinstrument) tonight.
I was in the middle of the build when I realized that the mal headers for the top board are missing.

Just ordered some on [Chip and Love](https://www.chipandlove.ch/fr/accueil/85-2-barrettes-40-broches-254mm-85.html). I hope they will come soon.
