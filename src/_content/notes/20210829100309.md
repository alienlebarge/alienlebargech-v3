The educational and sharing aspect of [@wntrblm](https://twitter.com/wntrblm/status/1427410069654757380)) « [Speak to me](https://twitter.com/wntrblm/status/1427410069654757380) » really attract me.

When in vacation with the whole family, the 15 kids around always asked me what I was doing with this case full of cool knobs (my eurorack travel/vacation system).
Instead of looking for a (charged) speaker around the house (and not finding one) or giving my headphone to one of them and not being able to listen to what I do, it would have been much easier to just turn « Speak to me »’s shiny knob and share with them.
