[Blast](https://www.blastradio.com/) ([@ListentoBlast](https://twitter.com/ListentoBlast)) looks very intriguing. 

- It's an easy way to stream studio quality audio
- All content expires after 24 hours so there's no pressure
- Easy (no-brain) setup

The [about page](https://www.blastradio.com/pages/about) has really good arguments for that kind of service.

> Being heard is a fundamental human need. And people want to listen. A century of radio has proven that.

> Social platforms create community and connection -- especially between creators and their audience. Yet today, most all social platforms are built for visual media -- photo and video content.

> Phone recordings sound like voicemails, professional equipment is expensive and cumbersome, and everything in between gets lost in the shuffle of memes, models and e-gamers on platforms built for visual media.  

> In a time where devices and screens consume our every waking minute, we need a break. A chance to sit back and listen.

> Blast removes the barriers of live audio creation and consumption. So creators can be heard and fans can listen.
