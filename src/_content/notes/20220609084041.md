I need some help.
I'm looking for a technique to rename a bunch of files and folders.

```
2005_03_19_this_is_the_filename.md -> 2021/01/filename/index.md
2007_07_23_another_filename.md     -> 2021/01/filename/index.md
2021_01_12_filename.md             -> 2021/01/filename/index.md
```

Here's [the regex I want to use](https://regex101.com/r/F9zU3z/5): 
- Regex: `/(\d{4})_(\d{2})_(\d{2})_(.*).md/gm`
- Substitusion: `$1/$2/$4/index.md`
