This is my first patch with [Mutable Instruments Rings](https://alienlebarge.ch/photos/2021/12/y7sxu/). 
It feel like being in a sad black and white movie.

A sample from Radio Music is feed into into Ears. Ears "gate" output goes into Rings's "strum", "out" into "in" and "env" into "brightness". Then both outputs of Rings are feeding Beads.
meloDICER is modulating Rings "v/oct".
