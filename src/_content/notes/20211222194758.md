This is my first patch with [Mutable Instruments Rings](https://alienlebarge.ch/photos/2021/12/y7sxu/). 
It feel like being in a sad black and white movie.

A sample from Radio Music is feed into into Ears. Ears <samp>gate</samp> output goes into Rings <samp>strum</samp>, <samp>out</samp> into <samp>in</samp> and <samp>env</samp> into <samp>brightness</samp>. Then both outputs of Rings are feeding Beads.
meloDICER is modulating Rings <samp>v/oct</samp>.
