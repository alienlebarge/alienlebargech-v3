Just curious, where do you buy your vinyl records ?

I used to buy them online on [Bleep](https://bleep.com/). But I just discovered that, you can buy them on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), so I just ordered some of Accidental Records latest releases.

The physical stores where you go there to talk, chill, listen to music and then go home with a bag full of EPs miss me. Is there any good in the Lausanne area ?
