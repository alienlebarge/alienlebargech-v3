I was concerned that the commands of the [quadrax](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/quadrax/) were too complicated.
After a few days of use it turns out that it is quite simple to remember the different functions and key combinations. There are just the LFO forms that are hard to remember. But other than that it's really a nice moduleï¿¼.
