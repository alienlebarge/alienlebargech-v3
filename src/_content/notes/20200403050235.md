After testing [kDrive](https://www.infomaniak.com/kdrive) for almost 3 months, I am leaving Dropbox for the [@infomaniak](https://twitter.com/infomaniak) solution.
What made me switch:
- My data is hosted in Switzerland
- My data is not analyzed
- Green datacenter
- The legal fort is in Switzerland
- Cheaper than Dropbox
- Identical functionality
