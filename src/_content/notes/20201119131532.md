Iâ€™m sick of having to scroll through stories to see what's new in the eurorack/modular community. Please, people and manufacturers that have a website, publish on it and not only on social media.

But please, please, please, not only Instagram stories. That is the worst.In order of (my) preferred communication channels:
1. Website   RSS
2. Twitter / Mastodon / Micro.blog
3. Instagram / TikTok
