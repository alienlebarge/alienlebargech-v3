Me doodling about AUX SEND knobs ...

This is a comment I made on [@mylarmelodies](https://twitter.com/mylarmelodies/)'s post [Patreon preview: PRE/POST SENDS Explained](https://www.patreon.com/posts/patreon-preview-45325751) on Patreon

> Nice video, Alex. Thanks !

> Imagine the AUX SEND knob acting like a balance between DRY and WET: from 7 o'clock to 12 o'clock, it adds WET signals from 0 to 100% and from 12 to 5 o'clock, it removes the DRY signal (set with VOL MUTE) from 100% to 0.
