  alt: The Mimeophon module in my hands
---
Hello [Mimeophon](http://www.makenoisemusic.com/modules/mimeophon)!

This beauty arrived a few hours ago and it has already find a spot in the case.
I got it to have richer melodies and fill the background with atmospheric sounds.
After a quick test run all I can say is "woah !".

Looping sounds in it and modeling them is so inspiring. A simple recorded conversation can become an awesome music material.

Can't wait to play more with this module.
