Last night soldering session bring to the rack a [Robaux 3pt](https://www.robaux.io/3pt).

The modes that interest me the most are:

- Tripot create some macro to perform live
- LFO to bring life to patches
- Euclidean Rhythm to trigger the bass. I regret that we cannot control the density of triggers with the big knob.
