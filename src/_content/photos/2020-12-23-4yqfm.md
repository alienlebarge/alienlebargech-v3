Looks what arrives today: Some cables from [@Polar_Noise](https://twitter.com/Polar_Noise) and the new [Data Bender](https://www.qubitelectronix.com/shop/data-bender) from [@qubitelectronix](https://twitter.com/qubitelectronix).

This thing is awesome ! I have only played with it for a few hours and this is so much fun. It brings such musical unpredictability in your music. Droids and broken hi-fi system singing in your system.

I love it.
