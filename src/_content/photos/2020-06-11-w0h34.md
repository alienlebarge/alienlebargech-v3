[Arbhar](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/arbhar/) is a new addition to the system.

Since I saw it in [Divkids video at Superbooth 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ElweUJB4pA), It will be mine soon or later.

Why this module ? Simply because it seems it will brings me in unexplored territories. Granular synthesis has always attracted me.

I would like to create and discover new sound, new textures and escape from the classic 4x4 tempo. I think this module is the way to go.

Ho and I love the interface. It's unique and so well tought. And you now wich other module has a unique interface ? ... [LÃºbadh](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/lubadh/) ðŸ‘€
