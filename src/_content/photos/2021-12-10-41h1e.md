The build of [Castor & Pollux](https://winterbloom.com/shop/castor-and-pollux-kit) by [@wntrblm](https://twitter.com/wntrblm) went smoothly. The module with his glowing stars is wonderful in the night. My kids said it is the prettiest.

And the packaging is 5 stars ! Love it.
I really had a great time soldering it.
