I must stop watching [@jjbbllkk](https://twitter.com/jjbbllkk) videos or I will buy every single module he demonstrate.

The Ensemble Oscillator by [@4msCompany](https://twitter.com/4msCompany) and [@mqtthiqs](https://twitter.com/mqtthiqs) is dope ! The first time I listen to it, It remembers me the big church organs. With a little reverb, it's gorgeous.
