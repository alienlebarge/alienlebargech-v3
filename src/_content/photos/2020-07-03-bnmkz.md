  alt: Rnd Step module in my hand
---
[Rnd Step](https://divkidvideo.com/rnd-step-the-third-divkid-eurorack-module/) by [@DivKid](https://twitter.com/divkid) and [@SteadyStateFate](https://twitter.com/SteadyStateFate)is here. Perfect timing for the week-end.

The main reason why I get this module, is to humanise my patch. Adding some randomness is always good.
Another thing I can't wait to test, is creating a bassline based on a meldody from the Bloom. Mainly because it's impossible to deal live with two sequences on the Bloom.
