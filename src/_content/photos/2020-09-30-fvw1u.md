The long-awaited [Euclidean Circles V2](http://vpme.de/euclidean-circles/) and the [Passive LPG 1U](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/1u/passive-lpg-1u/) by [@intellijel](https://www.twitter.com/intellijel) have arrived.

The Euclidean Circles is on my list since the beginning of my modular journey. I'm a big fan of euclidean rythme. I discovered them on the excellent videos by [@mylarmelodies](https://twitter.com/mylarmelodies) and [Quincas Moreira](https://www.youtube.com/c/SynthDiyGuy/).
After some hours of jam with this module, I can say that it is a real joy to play with it live.
I can't wait to pair it with  [EC Mute](https://leipzigwest.org/?page_id=303) when it will be available. In the meantime [Six Switches](https://vpme.de/six-switches/) will be the partner in crime.

I have never used LPG. This is a new thing to discover. The first noises that pass through this module are very promising and sound more natural than with a classic VCA.
