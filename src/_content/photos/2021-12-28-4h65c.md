New module day !

Two [SOR](https://www.siammodular.com/takaab-sor-dual-switched-passive-logic-or-gate) and one [2LPG v2](https://www.siammodular.com/takaab-2lpg-v2-dual-passive-low-pass-gate-eurorack-synthesizer-module) from Takaab.

SOR are dual switched passive logic OR gate. To start, I have planned to put them between Euclidean Circles v2 and Grids and test how this combo can drive a drum section.

The dual passive low pass gate 2LPG v2 is more here for experimenting and see what I can get out of it.
