Steppy by [@intellijel](https://www.twitter.com/intellijel) is here !
It was oit of stock almost everywhere but the good guys at [@ElevatorSound](https://www.twitter.com/ElevatorSound) had some. 

I grab one mainly for two things:

1. Trigger drums
2. Trigger reset for the sequencer like the meloDICER to create some variation

But of course, these are not the only two things it will be use for.
