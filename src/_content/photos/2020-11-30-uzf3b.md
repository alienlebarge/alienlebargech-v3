[Second board](https://alienlebarge.ch/photos/2020/11/f2xcb.html) is done and the Crush Delay sandwich is now completed.

Iâ€™ve played with it a few minute and it is instant fun. 

But ... suddenly, the delayes have disappear. The crush sound is always there. When I move the board, delays reappear. Apparently, I have to go through some bug fixing.
