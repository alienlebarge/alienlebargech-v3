  alt: The three modules in my hands
---
Three new modules arrived today:
1. [Noise Engineering Lapsus Os](https://www.noiseengineering.us/shop/lapsus-os) to attenuate, attenuverte and offset voltages and because I have a live oriented rack I want to play with those voltages during the performance2. [Frap Tools 321](https://frap.tools/products/321/) because I need a mixer that can add gain to modules with low outputs and it's ultra-versatile.3. [Intellijel USB Power 1U](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/1u/usb-power-1u/) to bring some light by plugin a USB light in it

Letâ€™s plug them and jam ! ... and then read manuals
