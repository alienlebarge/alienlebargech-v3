The [Tš-L](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/tsl/) is my first analog oscillator. It can do so much with a so little footprint. It’s perfect for a live system.

The video [Tš-L Overview](https://youtu.be/n37Gn-_sTn0) by Instruo and [Instruo Tš-L and vincâ are Chocolate and Peanut Butter: Modular Monday](https://youtu.be/VZabgjAJwiY) by [@jjbbllkk](https://twitter.com/jjbbllkk) have sold me on getting one.

Now, let's have some fun with it ?
