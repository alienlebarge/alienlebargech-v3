This [A-182-2 Quad Mult](http://www.doepfer.de/a1822.htm) is my first Doepfer module. (It's a shame after one year and a half into Eurorack and ~400hp of modules to get one from the guy who invented this format.)

The purpose of this little passive module is to be the interface between my two drums sequencers. It will sit between the [Euclidean Circles V2](https://vpme.de/euclidean-circles/) and the [Grids](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/). His littles switches will allow me to select between one of these two sequencers which ones will trigger the drums or mute the channel.

A big thanks to [@mylarmelodies](https://mobile.twitter.com/mylarmelodies) and his [video about mult modules](https://youtu.be/iIAC1Cew9r8).
