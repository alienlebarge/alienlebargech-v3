The space in the case had been reserved for weeks.
[Øchd](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/ochd/), the module released from the collaboration between [@DivKid](https://twitter.com/divkid) and [Instruo](https://www.instruomodular.com/) has finally arrived. After days of hot weather, bad weather comes at the right time to lock up and play with it to make patches breath. Yeah !

This is my first Instruo module (and perhaps not the last… hello Arbhar). I am amazed by the quality of the module and packaging. Bravo ! 

And by the way, what is this accompanying game card?
