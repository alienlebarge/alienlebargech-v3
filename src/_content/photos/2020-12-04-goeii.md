    alt: The meloDICER module
---
I received this beauty of [meloDICER](https://www.vermona.com/en/products/modules/product/melodicer/) by [@vermonagear](https://twitter.com/vermonagear) the other day and completely forgot to post a picture of it.

The melodic sequencer that has always intrigued me is the [Metropolis](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/metropolis/). It is so intuitive and easy to play with. But then the meloDICER arrives. The main difference between the two is randomness. And I love randomness.

With the Metropolis, you decide everything. On the meloDICER, you set probabilities and the module generate a melody and a rhythm based on your settings.
It's a joy to play with it especially in a live situation. It has already taken me to melodic territory I have never been too.
