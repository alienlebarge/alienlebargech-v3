If you are interrested, I'm selling a Make Noise Rosie eurorack module.

This module was purchased on 24.04.2019 from [Audiosource](https://www.audiosource.ch) in Lausanne. It is therefore still under warranty. The invoice will be provided with the module.

It has always been used with care in a non-smoking studio and screwed with plastic washers. There is no rack rash on the plate.
It is in mint condition.

It is supplied with the original box and screws.

You will find more information on [Make Noise website](http://www.makenoisemusic.com/modules/rosie)

[Buy it on ricardo.ch](https://www.ricardo.ch/fr/a/rosie-make-noise-1100564208/)
