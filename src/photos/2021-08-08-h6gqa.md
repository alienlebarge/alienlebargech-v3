Finally !

I finally added an [Akemie's Taiko](https://busycircuits.com/alm015/) from [@busycircuits](https://twitter.com/busycircuits) to my rack. This module has always been in the back of my mind since I got started with modular synthesizers. All thanks to the videos of [Knobs](https://youtu.be/8Mgy--7lY0A "ALM - Akemie's Taiko & Pamela's New Workout on Youtube") and [Andrew Huang](https://youtu.be/tDFX_hDcPAo "Walkthrough & Space Beats on YouTube").
