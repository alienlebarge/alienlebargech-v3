I watched [@mylarmelodies](https://www.twitter.com/mylarmelodies)’s [video about the Metropolis](https://youtu.be/uV9-XA5MPwY) dozen of times. To be honest, this is one of the video that get me into Eurorack.

I was fascinated by the imediacity of the Metropolis. Since then, it was on my « someday I will have one » list.

Four weeks ago the good folks of [@intellijel](https://twitter.com/intellijel) released his successor: the [Metropolix](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/metropolix/). The time has come. After macking some space in my rack (bye bye Varigate 8 ). I ordered the last Metropolis I found in Switzerland.

The hardcore sequencer nerd I am is happy to have a new one to play with.
