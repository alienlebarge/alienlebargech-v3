    alt: A black and white photograph taken through a circular porthole window. Through the window, there's a view of a traditional alpine chalet with a snow-covered roof. The wooden structure has a chimney, and snow-covered mountains are visible in the background. The circular frame of the porthole creates a striking compositional element against the plain wall.

    alt: A close-up view of skis on groomed snow, photographed from above. The tips of two black skis are visible against pristine white snow that shows parallel grooming lines. The texture of the packed snow is clearly visible with its characteristic linear patterns created by the grooming machine. The image has a strong geometric quality with the parallel lines of both the ski tracks and grooming marks.

    alt: An indoor handball match in progress. A young player in an orange and black jersey (likely number 2) is handling the ball while being defended by players in blue and black uniforms (one wearing number 17). The scene takes place in an indoor sports hall with typical handball court markings visible on the floor. The image captures the dynamic movement of handball, with the attacking player in mid-motion while controlling the ball.

Here is my proposal for the #TheCompoChallenge proposed by @hiro@social.lol

Two photos were taken during our ski vacation in the Alps last week.
The last one is a handball photo. It had been years since I had taken any. It's not very easy to get very elaborate framing since the sport is so fast-paced. But it was fun.
