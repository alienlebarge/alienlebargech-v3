The [Squid Salmple](https://busycircuits.com/alm022/) by [@busycircuits](https://twitter.com/busycircuits) is in my rack since the beginning of my modular journey. It was here to serve as drum module but rapidly discovered that it can be a lot more. I used it as an enveloppe generator when I had none of them, I recorded LFOs in it when I got none of them, it has been a kind of random trigger generator, etc.

I can’t recommend enough this module. You can do so much with it. 
The Squid has improved with the years with some [notables updates](https://busycircuits.com/firmware/alm022/ChangeLog.txt).

Yesterday the [Axon-1](https://busycircuits.com/alm022-exp1/) expander show off in my mailbox (after spending almost three weeks in Milano’s customs although he was sent from Signal Sound in Glasgow). This module is a great expansion to the Squid. It give you four more CVs to mangles and control your samples.

The week-end is sunny but I will spend some times in front of my rack.
