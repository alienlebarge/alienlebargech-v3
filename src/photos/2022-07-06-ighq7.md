Look who showed up in the mail !
I was waiting for Stolperbeats for so long that I took this picture and then jammed for two hours straight. This module is groovy as hell. I was able to play swingy wonky minimal techno I love in a few minutes. Thanks [Making Sound Machines](https://makingsoundmachines.com/) for this wonderful machine.
I will try to post some jam snippets soon.
