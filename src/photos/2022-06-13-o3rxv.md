A few weeks ago, I get two modules I wanted for a long time: [HPO](https://busycircuits.com/alm019/) and [Marbles](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/marbles/).

## HPO

HPO used in side cases I build to focus on a particular module or take on vacation. It is only 2hp width. Perfect for small systems.

## Marbles

When Emilie put Marbles as a discontinued module, I hurry to buy one. It was ont radar for a long time. I love the happy accidents I run into when using it.
