Day 8: I have been in hospital for a week. Today there is change. We are in Switzerland and it is Sunday. So we had some [Swiss plaited loaf](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/food-wine/recipe/bernese-plait/) for breakfast.

On the health side, things are starting to get better. But I have to wait until Monday to get to the bottom of it. There is no doctor on weekends to diagnose my analyzes.
