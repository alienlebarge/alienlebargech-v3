    alt: Black and white portrait of a cat viewed through a cat door. The square frame of the cat flap creates a perfect border around the feline's face, establishing a strong geometric composition. The cat's whiskers and features stand out distinctly in this intimate view.

    alt: Self-portrait in a bathroom mirror framed by beige tiles. Everyday objects - toothbrushes, towels, and accessories - line the composition, while a Ninjago decorative towel adds a pop of color in the background. The rectangular frame of the mirror naturally structures the image.

    alt: View framed through a blurry, irregular opening, capturing a skater in black at the top of a skate ramp. The natural framing creates a striking contrast between the dark areas in the foreground and the skater's silhouette against the bright sky. The black and white composition enhances the dramatic effect of the scene.

Here are my three submissions for this week's theme of the [#TheCompoChallenge](https://social.lol/tags/thecompochallenge), which focused on frames. I must admit, I didn't have much time. All three photos were taken hastily on the last day. I hope I found something decent.

The skatepark photo is quite deceptive; I simply made a circle with my fingers. As for the bathroom photo, I like it, even though I find it a bit too easy.
