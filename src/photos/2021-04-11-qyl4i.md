Finally, those four bad boys are assembled. I spent four evening soldering each one of these amazing [Prok modules](https://www.thonk.co.uk/product-category/manufacturer/prok-modular/prok-drums/) didicated to drums duties.

I played a little with theme and they sound fantastic. Next step is two tweak sounds to build my own performable drum library.
