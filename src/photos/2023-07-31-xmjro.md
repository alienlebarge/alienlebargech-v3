After some misadventures during its soldering, I finally finished the 4ms DIY Sampler.

Tip: Be careful with the 10V and 100V resistors. They look very similar and there are the same number of them in the kit. It is easy to make the mistake of swapping them.

I have already played around with it and I really like how easy it is to manage the samples.
