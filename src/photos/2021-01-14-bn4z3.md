Clubs are closed, bring the club to the house !

When I was a child, my uncle was running a disco mobile in Biel. I was fascinated by all the light show. One day, when I was ten or something, he let me play with a bar of spots when they were installing the material in the afternoon. I remember that day like it was yesterday. It was so cool !!!

Today, I received (from [@Schneidersladen](https://twitter.com/Schneidersladen)) the [Doepfer A-197-3](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112013133/http://www.doepfer.de/a1973.htm). It's a LED controller. You plug a LED stripe in it and have fun like if you are ten. And it's cool !
