Finally a rectifier in my rack! Originally, I wanted one to go with Ochd. But I think this "[Dual Rectifier II - S](https://blacknoisemodular.com/products/dual-rectifier-ii-s)" from Black Noise Modular will have many other uses.

The construction went very smoothly. It felt good to get out my soldering kit.

And did you see this? It has the serial number 001!
