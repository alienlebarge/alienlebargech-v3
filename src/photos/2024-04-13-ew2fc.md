First day in Lisbon.

We arrived in the early afternoon. After dragging our suitcases on the cobblestones of Lisbon, we took possession of our apartment in the _Bairro Alto_ district.
After exploring the area and the _Miradouro de São Pedro de Alcântara_ viewpoint, we went to eat in a typical restaurant. A delightful culinary discovery. I recommend the [Artis](https://www.artiswinebar.pt/) restaurant.
