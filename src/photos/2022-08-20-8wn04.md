The new M4 [Droid](https://shop.dermannmitdermaschine.de/pages/droid-universal-cv-processor) controller arrived earlier this week. This module is so clever and versatile. You can program it do a bunch of stuff base on circuits (functions) availables.
The four faders are motorized and can emulate notches or kind of pitch bend wheel.

If you are interested, I am currently, learning how to use it by coding a sequencer.
