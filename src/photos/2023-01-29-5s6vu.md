Wave Packets by [Auza Audio](https://www.auzaaudio.com/) is a multi-talented complex modulation and audio source.

I am really impressed with the capabilities of this module. This modulation powerhouse produce really musical waveforms.

It can be used as a LFO and VCO.

> Wave Packets is a multi-talented complex modulation and audio source. The module allows you to craft 'wave packets', with each of the 5 main outputs deploying a different recipe from the contour function (linear segments between each time stage) and frequency-dynamic oscillator (LFO or audio-rate oscillation which transitions through 3 target frequencies) to produce a unique modulation shape, burst of energy, or fragment/ phrase of audio.
