Today, we had the privilege of visiting [La Berra](https://www.laberra.ch/) for the first time, a mountain nestled in the Swiss Prealps. The view from the summit was simply breathtaking. We decided to hike down. An unforgettable day in nature.

And what better way to end a day than with a great fondue among friends?
