Yesterday, I built the [DivSkip](https://divkidvideo.com/divskip/) module, and it is truly exceptional. Compact and full of possibilities, it integrates seamlessly into your modular system. The construction is quick and straightforward.
I highly recommend this module. If you have some soldering skills, opt for the kit. It's cost-effective.

Thanks to [Divkid](https://divkidvideo.com/https://) and [Making Sound Machines](https://makingsoundmachines.com) for developing this outstanding module. I'm sure it will remain a staple in my collection.
