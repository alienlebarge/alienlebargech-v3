Here are some jams made with the TAKT sequencer from Flame Instruments. It's important to note that this sequencer, like a looper, means that the sequences are recorded live. It's all part of an empty pattern that I programmed as the set progressed. I really appreciate this sequencer behind me; I really like it a lot. It's truly wonderful to use and very efficient. I still have some familiarization issues, but I'm already able to do some pretty decent things.

In the last set, I also have a melodic sequencer, the TON, which uses a proximity sensor to create melodies. It's really fun to use, but again, I need to spend more time practicing to master it well.

That's it, I hope you'll enjoy these few sets made during my vacation on a 104hp 7U eurorack system.
