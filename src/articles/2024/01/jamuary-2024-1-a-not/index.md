Happy New Year to everyone!

As we begin the new year 2024, a new series of jams for "Jamuary" is coming. For this new series, I've decided to change my publishing approach, particularly for videos. I plan to use Penpot and ChatGPT to create video thumbnails. I hope this will save me time in publishing.

On the musical side, I must admit I wasn't fully prepared. I used a patch that had been set up a few days ago for bass line generation exploration. The modules aren't even properly fixed in the case. For this bass line, I'm using the "Auza Wave Packet" and the "Mutable Instruments Blades".
