I was eagerly awaiting it, but in the end, I'm disappointed with the new family-oriented offer proposed by [HEY](https://www.hey.com/).

In my opinion, a family service should allow for information sharing and easy communication among its members. I expected this to be based on the "HEY for domains" solution but limited to 5 members. This would have allowed us, for example, 
- to use Collections in family projects, 
- to share emails to discuss vacation offers,
- and so on.

While waiting for this offer to become available, I had already reserved a domain name for our family. My spouse and I were already successfully using the "HEY for domains" service. We discussed offers from craftsmen for our renovation projects, synchronized our communication with the school, organized our vacation destinations, and so on.

In the end, "HEY for family" is nothing more than a billing offer for 5 "@hey.com" email addresses with no sharing possibilities between them.

Don't get me wrong, I love HEY. But switching our entire family to this service won't be as easy as I had anticipated.
