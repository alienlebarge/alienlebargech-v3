The jam is sequenced with Pamela Pro Workout and DivSkip, with all sounds coming from the Squid Salmple and Plaits for melody. Effects are added by the MFX and everything is mixed together by Tangle Quartet.

The samples are the voices of my children participating in an escape game. I'm pleased with the result, though I consider balancing the samples a bit more.
