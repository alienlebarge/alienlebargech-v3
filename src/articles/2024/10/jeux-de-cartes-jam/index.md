All the small scratchy sounds come from samples I made with a deck of cards. I'm not quite happy with the result yet. I still need to work on managing the samples in the Squid Salmple. But it's a start.

The sequencing is done by the Pamela Pro Workout and the DivSkip. I really appreciate the ease of using the DivSkip and performing with it.
