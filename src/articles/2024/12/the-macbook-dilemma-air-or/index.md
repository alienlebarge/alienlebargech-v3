Since 2018, I've been using a 13-inch MacBook Pro with an i5 processor. After six years of faithful service, it's starting to struggle when multiple applications are running simultaneously. It's time for an upgrade.
## My Usage and Needs
Currently, I'm facing a dilemma: choosing between a MacBook Pro M4 and a MacBook Air M3. My main activities on the computer are:
- Web development
- Music production with Ableton Live
- DJing with Traktor
- Some basic video editing
## Going Back to Basics?
In the past, I owned an 11-inch MacBook Air that remains, to this day, my favorite Mac. I particularly appreciated its exceptional portability and compact format. This positive experience makes me lean towards the new MacBook Air.
## The Price and Performance Dilemma
The price difference between the two models is significant. I find myself faced with two options:
- A MacBook Air with high-end specifications
- A MacBook Pro M3, a higher-end model, for a similar budget
## The Question Remains Open
Is a MacBook Pro really necessary for my usage? This is the central question in my reflection. What would you do in my position?
