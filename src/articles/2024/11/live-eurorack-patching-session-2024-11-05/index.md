Three days ago, I conducted a live patching session with my Eurorack system. Nothing was prepared beforehand. It was pure improvisation. I apologize for the video orientation; it's in portrait mode because I streamed this session live on Instagram. Feel free to skip any parts that seem too long. It's truly exploratory.

## The pros and cons

- **What I liked**: the ease of sequencing live with the TAKT and the TON. These two sequencers are truly excellent. In the end, the session with the samples from the 4ms Sampler turned out really interesting. Running the drums through the Tryptich adds a captivating dimension.
- **Areas for improvement**: I need to learn to manage the bass better. I feel like I always add too much. But it's so good!
