Here we are again in January, and as every year, I try to offer you musical gems as often as possible. However, I can't make any guarantees. For this first session, I decided to explore the possibilities offered by the Blades module from Mutable Instruments. My goal was to create a melody accompanied by a bass line.

To add variations to the melody, I used the Compare 2 from Joranalogue, which modifies certain parameters of the Blades module. In the second part of the session, I integrated a kick, but the result became very industrial. Therefore, it's an experience reserved for discerning ears. Get ready!

The end of the session is particularly interesting. It features melody variations performed live using the meloDICER sequencer from Vermona. It's a tool I'm still hesitant to sell because I can't make up my mind. The meloDICER is a very straightforward and easy-to-use sequencer. I appreciate its ability to quickly produce good results, even though variations need to be introduced through other modules. I'm not sure how long it will remain in my collection.

I hope you enjoy this session and find pleasure in it. I'll try to publish sessions as often as possible. See you soon and until next time!
