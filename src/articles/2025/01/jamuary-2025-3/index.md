For this year's third jam session, I've taken a creative turn by incorporating a filter to craft a bassline with a touch of feedback. The results are quite interesting, and I'm excited to share them with you all. 

In terms of rhythm, I've kept the foundation from the previous patch, specifically using the DivSkip to sequence everything rhythm-based. It turns out quite nice, so here it is.I hope you enjoy the sound.
