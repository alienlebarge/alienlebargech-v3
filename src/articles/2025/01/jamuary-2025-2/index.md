Second day and second jam of the year. Sticking to the plan feels great. I hope to keep this momentum going! Today, we're diving into some modular magic with the DivSkip module, crafted by Divkid and Making Sound Machines. It's the conductors in this musical setup, directing the rhythms using the ALM Squid Salmple. We’re having fun with some sounds from the UTTU library, spiced up with a few effects.

I've got to say, the DivSkip is an incredible little powerhouse. It’s compact yet offers endless possibilities. Plus, it’s a DIY module, which is why I highly recommend it. Seriously, it’s a perfect starter module. If you’re just venturing into the world of Eurorack, this is one module you’ll want in your arsenal right from the beginning. It packs a lot into such a small package.

That wraps up today’s session. Hope you enjoy it, and until next time!
