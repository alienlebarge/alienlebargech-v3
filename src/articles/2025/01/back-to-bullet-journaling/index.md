One of my new resolutions for 2025 is to get back into bullet journaling. It’s a practice I used to engage in, and it suited me well.

I’ve abandoned it recently, but this note-taking method allowed me to be more focused and engaged in my tasks. It really worked for me.

## The Tools

### The Notebook

I started the year with a Baron Fig Confidant Plus, but it was really too big and therefore impractical to carry and handle. After a few days, I changed and opted for the official Bullet Journal notebook, which is smaller and available in Switzerland, allowing me to avoid exorbitant shipping fees. I had concerns about the thickness of the paper. I really appreciate the paper from Baron Fig. Well, the paper weight was increased in the second version of the Bullet Journal notebook, and it’s great.

### Writing Instruments

I paired the notebook with a ballpoint pen and a fixpencil.
It's the Caran d'Ache 843 pen that I've been using for several years, and it’s indestructible. I accompanied it with a fixpencil from the same brand. I preferred a fixpencil over a traditional mechanical pencil because it resembles a traditional pencil more closely and, additionally, it reminds me of my learning years when I used one. Plus, the cap of the fixpencil holds a pencil sharpener, which is quite convenient.

I’m very satisfied with this setup that allows me to quickly grab everything and throw it into my bag.

I hope that returning to Bullet Journaling will help me with my organization. Fingers crossed!
