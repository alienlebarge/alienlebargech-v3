The Spotify algorithm doesn't really show me anything new. I prefer [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) which offers me much more interesting artists.

In the last few days, I discovered [radiooooo](https://radiooooo.com/) (with five "o"). It's a website that allows you to share the best tracks in your music library and let others discover them.
It's more focused on older tracks but you can discover or rediscover some real gems.

Radioooo allows you to find tracks by country and by decade. Itâ€™s like a global musical time machine!
