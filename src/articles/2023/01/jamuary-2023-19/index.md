This last jamuary is inspired by the _Auto Harmony generator_ patch by @DivKid which is in the [RND STEP manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nErMN8mrhiv5nBEkp0VlVfeUsxF68Zgh/view).

The _Wave_ and _Sub_ output of MCO and the _Pulse_ output of TÅ¡-L are used to create the melody sequenced by meloDICER.
