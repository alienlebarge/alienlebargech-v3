The motivation was not there today. I had to unpatch the yesterday’s session and I hadn’t got any idea for this one.

Usually when I unpatch the modular, I quickly patch a sound source and a sequencer to get a background melody. This time, I used Marbles and Plaits and then ideas came. What I use Beads as a sound source to and tune it with Plaits. Minutes later this ambient sound was here.
