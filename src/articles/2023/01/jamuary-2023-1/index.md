Jamuary is here. Here we go again !!!
I will try to post one jam per day so don't expect perfection. The current record is 25 jams during the month of January 2021. We'll try to beat it.

This is the first test to record directly on my iPhone using [the new Volt 276](https://alienlebarge.ch/articles/2022/12/new-and-first-audio-interface/).

I am making some beats with Squid Salmple and his stock 707 samples and TH-30 distortion preset of the MFX. Stolperbeats and IDUM are sequencing all that.
