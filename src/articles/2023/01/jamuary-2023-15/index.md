That's it, we did better than last year!

In 2022, I had made 14 jams and we are at the 15th this year

I received today the Wave Packets from [Auza Audio](https://www.auzaaudio.com). This module can generate envelopes as well as LFOs or be used as an oscillator. It is in this last role that it is used in this patch. This is an improvisation to explore the sounds it can produce. And I have only one thing to say, I love it!
