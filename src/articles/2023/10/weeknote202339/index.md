Here's what caught attention during week 39:

- We celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary.
- We've had our new car, the Dacia Jogger, for over a week now. I'm impressed by its fuel efficiency. We're averaging about 4.8 l/100 km.
- Instruo still hasn't released version 2 of its Arbhar module. I'm eagerly awaiting it.
- This weekend, [Machina Bristronica](https://machinabris.wpengine.com/) took place in Bristol. This event brings together synthesizer enthusiasts and is organized by [Elevator Sound](https://www.elevatorsound.com/). It's one of those events I'd like to attend someday. Plus, I've never been to Bristol and it seems like a beautiful city.
- I wonder if "weeknotes" make sense and if they aren't just [notes](/notes/) that I could write as they come to mind, rather than grouping them by week. The disadvantage I see is that one cannot discuss a particular topic via a web mention, as a weeknote encompasses several topics.
- The weather is incredibly hot and beautiful for the season, another thing that I find concerning from a climatic perspective.
- The [playdate](https://www.play.date) arrived last week. I'm a fan of this little console. This week, I've been hooked on [Whitewater Wipeout](https://play.date/games/whitewater-wipeout/). This game is incredibly simple but addictive. Besides, I've set up my development environment. We'll see if it leads to something.
