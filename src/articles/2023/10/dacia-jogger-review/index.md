It's been a month since we received our 7-seater [Dacia Jogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia_Jogger){rel=external} hybrid and have traveled about 2000 kilometers. It's time to share our thoughts. Here are [the aspects we liked](#positive-points) and [those we didn't](#negative-points) so far.

## Positive points

-  The price is unbeatable.
-  As a hybrid, it consumes little fuel. So far, we have an average of about 5 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers. Our journeys are 70% on regional roads between 50 and 80 km/h and 20% on highways between 80 and 120 km/h.
-  The range is good. With a full tank, you can travel over 900 kilometers.
-  The comfort of use. Driving an electric car is a real pleasure. I had never driven a car with electric propulsion before. Well, I really like these silent starts.
-  The trunk space is enormous, and it's very easy to remove and replace the two foldable seats.
-  We can transport seven people, which is very convenient for our family of five.
-  The central seat in the back row is a real seat.
-  It is compatible with the Apple Car Play system. We did not take the navigation pack with the GPS. Instead, we use our mobile phone that connects via a USB cable.

## Negative points

-  The indicators are too discreet. You can't hear them when they're active. There's probably a way to configure them, but I haven't found it yet.
-  The soundproofing is noticeable. Beyond 100 km/h, there's a lot of wind noise at the driver and passenger windows. You'll need to drive with the music on.
-  The rearview camera is unusable in rainy weather.
-  When it rains, the blind spot warnings go off when a water droplet passes over them. This happens very often and it's annoying.
-  There's no storage in the trunk.
-  When the battery is low, the engine can kick in loudly to recharge it. It's quite startling, it sounds like a car driving in first gear at 60 km/h.
- <ins datetime="2023-11-01T06:29:57-02:00">The specifications changed between the order and delivery, and we ended up with copper-colored mirrors. This was not planned, and we find it terrible. It gives the car an appearance suited for older people.</ins>
