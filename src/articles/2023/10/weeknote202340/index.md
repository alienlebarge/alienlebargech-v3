Here is what interested me this week:

- Arc implements artificial intelligence in its browser under the name of [Arc Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7koAGLf0EE). The project is truly interesting. The automatic renaming of downloaded files and the ability to get a page summary by simply hovering over a link are really cool features. We will see in practice whether these will be useful.
- The sequencer [6 Eyes](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/crazy-chicken-six-eyes) from the Ukrainian manufacturer Crazy Chicken uses a very interesting concept to generate melodies. It appears simple, fast, and produces good results.
- We are still waiting for Intruo to release the v2 of arbhar's firmware
- I won't be writing a Weeknote article next week. Instead, I will simply post more notes on my website.
