Are you ready to rrrumble !!!

I remember the MC crying this in the microphone before Manu La Malin dropped a sick heavy hardcore beat by Laura Grabb. Yes, I was a hardcore fan in the 90'.

I tryed to replicate syncopated beats that I really enjoy in industrial hardcore of this period. Things like Laura Grabb, Somatic Responses, Senical, etc.
