This is the first jam I have done with [Stolperbeats](https://makingsoundmachines.com/stolperbeats/) by Making Sound Machines. It performs very well in a techno improvisation and I can't wait to use it more and explore his capabilities. The next step is to continue to build my own drum patterns and learn them.
