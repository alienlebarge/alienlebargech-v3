@paulrobertlloyd@mastodon.social What a game! 
There are many good individuals in the England team, but the collective play isn't working. 
In this Euro, apart from Spain and Germany a few times, no major teams have impressed me. 
The match against Switzerland will be interesting.

Hop Suisse ! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ðŸ˜‰
