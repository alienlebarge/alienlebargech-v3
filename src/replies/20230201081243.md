@brad_frost I use mainly KeyboardMaestro. The text expansion I use the most is when I type `;issue` it populate Jira or GitHub issues with the following text template:

```
### Description
_Include a high level description of the feature or error here including steps of how to recreate if applicable. Include any benefits, challenges or considerations. Can be short and sweet._

...

### Ask
_Describe the desired behavior and what would deem this issue/bug/feature complete._

...

### To Do

- [ ] Steps
- [ ] To
- [ ] Complete/Fix

### Additional Info
_Include any images, steps to recreate, notes, emojis, or whatever._

...
```
