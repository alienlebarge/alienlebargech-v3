@amerpie@social.lol Koofr looks really interesting but I'm going to keep using [Infomaniak's kDrive](https://www.infomaniak.com/en/ksuite/kdrive) (which I've been using for many years).
The reasons are as follows.
- It's based in Switzerland
- The data center only uses green energy
- It's accessible on the web, on Mac, on iOS, etc.
- Possibility of doing Smart Sync
- The price. ~5$/3TB (Koofr: ~20$/2.5TB)
