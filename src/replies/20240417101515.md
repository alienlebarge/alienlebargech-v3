@cabel@panic.com Hey! Just wanted to say your presentation is truly amazing. Thanks for sharing all those stories about this adventure. It's incredibly fascinating!

In our family, we absolutely love the Playdate. My kids have such a blast playing with it. I'm planning to try and develop a small game, but just haven't found the time to start yet. However, I'm brimming with ideas. Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
