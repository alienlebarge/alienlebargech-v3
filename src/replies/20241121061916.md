@matuzo@front-end.social Hehe, welcome to Switzerland. It's true that we don't have the same electrical sockets ([Type J](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets)). The advantage with us is that you can go practically anywhere in Europe without needing an adapter, as long as there's no earth ground.
Glad you could manage with your power bank ðŸ”‹
