Great new feature! Good job!

We’ve been waiting for this for years. The dates in the previous format were so unreadable to me. I will finally have dates in the DD-MM-YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD format. And that’s great. Thank you.

I’m a bit perplexed about the use of the exclamation point as a shortcut. In French, the exclamation point is preceded by a space, which causes the date picker to be displayed every time we want to write an exclamatory sentence. I encountered this problem after just 5 minutes of use.
