@btconf@mastodon.social It is clear that there is a much larger audience on Youtube and not on Vimeo. Personally, I watch a lot more videos on Youtube than on Vimeo.

But I have a Vimeo Pro account. I use it to host the music videos I make with my modular synthesizer and share them on my website. I use Vimeo because I trust it much more and I'm not interested in the number of views. The interface is easy to use and simple to understand. The important thing for me is to be able to host the videos and include them on my site. From time to time I share one on Youtube via Vimeo's sharing tools but it is rare.

If a video interests me, and it's available on both Youtube and Vimeo, I'm more likely to watch it on Vimeo.

I see Youtube as a social network full of ads and trackers and Vimeo as a video content management tool.
