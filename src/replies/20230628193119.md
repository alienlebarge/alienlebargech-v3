@christian@aldr.social I’m also a DT770 but for working, I use BOSE QUIETCONFORT 45. The sound quality is excellent and I wear them all day long without any problem.
The noise canceling works very well. My colleagues always have to make a big gesture to get my attention because I can't hear them talking to me.
