The latest album from the cowboys was released this morning. This is the last time we'll hear Karl sing new songs. RIP.
It makes me sad to think we won't see the band in concert anymore, dancing wildly to their tracks.

In 2006, we saw them for the first time in concert at [Paléo in Nyon](https://yeah.paleo.ch/fr/edition/2006 "The lineup for Paléo 2006."). Some time before, a coworker had told me about this band that his girlfriend had discovered in Quebec and was turning concert halls upside down. We went to this concert and, despite having listened to their album, we couldn't understand what Karl was singing with his beautiful accent. But we loved the concert. Since then, we've never let them go.

Merci
