Perhaps a Vim jedi can help me.

When editing a file with Vim, I always get a `.swp` file created aside.
I set the following configuration in `.vimrc` but it doesn't work:

```
set directory^=$HOME/.vim/swp//
```

The thing that my `~/.vim/` folder is an alias. 
Is this configuration compatible with aliases ?
