I ordered the new [Pamela's PRO Workout](https://busycircuits.com/alm034/) by @busycircuits@twitter.com because I love the previous version and need more tonic in my rack.

While waiting for the module to arrive, I went to read the documentation and the [firmeware changelog](https://busycircuits.com/firmware/alm034/release-notes.txt) and what did I see ?
A mention of an _Axon-2_ module !!! ðŸ‘€
