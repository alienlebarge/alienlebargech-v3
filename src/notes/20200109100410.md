When cross-posting with micro.blog, I would love to have a checkbox to always include a link back. Currently, [short posts without a title, and less than 280 characters have no link back](https://help.micro.blog/2016/cross-posting-twitter/).
[@help](https://micro.blog/help) is it something we can imagine ?
