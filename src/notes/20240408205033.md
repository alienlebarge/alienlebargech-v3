I am unable to get the micro.blog iOS client to work with Indiekit. When I enter my site's address, I encounter the following errors:

1. `Whoops, an error occurred trying to connect. Please try again.`
2. `An error occurred trying to connect. Please try again.`
3. `Sorry, we could not find the XML-RPC endpoint or Micropub API for your weblog.`

However, the MacOS client works correctly.

Does somebody have the same problem ?
