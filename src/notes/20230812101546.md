The new modules are:

-  **Steady State Fate - Ultra-Perc**: produces snare and hi-hats
-  **Jasmine & Olive Trees - Traffic**: modifies the CVs of the Ultra-Perc to produce different rhythmic sounds
-  **4ms -Sample DIY**: plays samples randomly
-  **Bela.io - Gliss**: allows to control the samples played by the Sampler
