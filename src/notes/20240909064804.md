I've played 155 hours of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, collected 31 hearts, completed 137 shrines, obtained the 5 spirits and 76 seeds, and found 210 Koroks. Yet, I still haven't faced the final boss. I really need to tackle it before the next Zelda game, which I'm already excited about, is released.
