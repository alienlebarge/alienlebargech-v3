It's hard to resist buying this [Rotring 600 3-in-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HllwqC4TNdc "A review of the Rotring on Youtube").

Today, two pens accompany my Bullet Journal (a Caran d'Ache 849 ballpoint pen and a Caran d'Ache Fixpencil mechanical pencil). This Rotring would replace both.

Can we ever have enough pens?
