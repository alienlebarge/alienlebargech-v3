In the family, I'm the one who always tells others to be careful with their passwords and online accounts, yet I've just been scammed. It's somewhat ironic. 
Someone is buying Apple gift cards and I'm the one receiving the bills. 

I'm looking forward to the long but straightforward process of filing a complaint. ðŸ˜‘
