This [#TheCompoChallenge](https://social.lol/tags/thecompochallenge) is making me seriously consider buying a camera again. It's been a few years since I sold all my magical boxes. But honestly, I'm hesitating.

It needs to be small and able to take nice photos. A [Fujifilm XM-5](https://www.fujifilm-x.com/en-gb/products/cameras/x-m5/) maybe?
