I would have liked to be pleasantly surprised by enjoying a Beyonc√© song. However, I find that only the first 40 seconds of her new song "[Texas Hold'em](https://youtu.be/jCOX8dT9q8M?si=XIbRoUI3epDYon14 "Texas Hold'em on Youtube")" are worth listening to. After that, as usual, it descends into being overly commercial.
