The opening ceremony of the Olympic Games was truly beautiful. Moving away from the usual stadium setting was a great idea. It looked really good on television, but I wonder how the live audience enjoyed the show.
The soundtrack was amazing. It showcases the musical richness of this country.
Thanks for the show.
