After many years of use, I replaced my Logitech K380 with a mechanical keyboard, the [Keychron K2 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-pro-qmk-via-wireless-mechanical-keyboard). This is an entry-level mechanical keyboard. 

I wanted to experience typing on a mechanical keyboard. After two days of use, my initial impression is that it reminds me of my childhood. I remember being in my father's office, typing on our Commodore 64 keyboard.

The first things I noticed when exploring this world are that it can easily become a rabbit hole. Also, it's not easy to find keyboards with a [QWERTZ Swiss-french layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTZ "QWERTZ keyboard on Wikipedia").
