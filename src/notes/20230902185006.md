What AI-powered applications are you using?

For me, I have been testing [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) for two months. I have not yet taken the annual subscription. I am waiting to see if AI is really a plus, but I must say that so far I am quite impressed. The only thing missing is a mobile version for quick note taking and querying AI when on the go.
