@effiksmusic I saw your droid repos on GitHub. If you want them to be listed the [`droid-eurorack` topic page](https://github.com/topics/droid-eurorack), do not forget to add it. This could help people who are not familiar with GitHub to find patches.

I generally add a mention about it at the end of my Droid repos README.md file. Here's [an exemple on alienlebarge/droid repo](https://github.com/alienlebarge/droid#find-other-droid-patch-on-github).

And btw, thanks for [the pull request](https://github.com/alienlebarge/droid/pull/6).
