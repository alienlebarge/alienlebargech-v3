My trusty AudioEngine A2 speakers have kicked the bucket after more than 15 years of loyal service. The speaker surround was torn. As soon as there was a bit of bass, it crackled as if a big bumblebee was in the room.
I got the new [Adam Audio D3V](https://www.adam-audio.com/en/news/industry/introducing-the-d3v-desktop-monitor/) and, for now, I'm really very satisfied. I've only had them for 24 hours, but I'm using them with all my reference songs. So far, they don't disappoint me at all. The quality is impressive considering their size.

In case you're wondering, the current track is The Audience by Herbert.
