The italics in the latest version of [MD IO](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/mass-driver/io) font by [@mass_driver_tm](https://twitter.com/mass_driver_tm) are excellent. Great balance between readability and quirkiness.

I'm using it in my editor since 9 month and it has become my coding font of choice.
