Little trick for better windows resizing using [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/): in [`SCREENVISIBLE`](https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/function/SCREEN) function, use the `Front` index name instead of `Main`. `Front` select the screen which contain the front window. It means that the window you are going to resize will stay on the same monitor if you work multiple monitors.
