Iconfactory has just launched [a crowdfunding campaign to develop Tapestry](https://web.archive.org/web/20240306174831/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry "Tapestry on Kickstarter"). Tapestry is an app that combines posts from compatible social networks into one timeline.

> What if you had one app that gave an overview of nearly everything that was 
happening across all the different services you follow? A single chronological timeline of your most important social media services, RSS feeds, and other sources. All of the updates together in one place, in the order they’re posted, with no algorithm deciding what you should see or when you should see it. That’s what we’d like to build.

I hate switching from one app to another to see what's new. Count me in.
