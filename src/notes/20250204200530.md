[Cloudron](https://www.cloudron.io) is now active on my tiny VPS (hooray!)
This has allowed me to reinstall an instance of [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org) (my personal Spotify) and [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) for RSS feed reading. All of this was installed with surprising ease.

The current monthly cost is:
-  VPS: 3 CHF
-  Domain Name: 1.62 CHF
-  SSL Certificate: 1.71 CHF

This totals to **6.33 CHF (~6.74 €) per month** !!!

For now, I haven't subscribed to Cloudron's pro plan. This means I can only install two applications. I'm waiting to see how it performs before spending 15€ per month to install [more](https://www.cloudron.io/store/index.html "List of apps supported by Cloudron").
