Looking at [the 2  hours long video](https://youtu.be/jws1TfWpdt8) demonstrating [Instruō Lubadh](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/lubadh/) v2.0 firmware.
Jason's videos are so dense and instruct full  that I must always do several learning sessions where I keep going back and forth between the module and the video.

This version makes of « Lubadh » almost whole new modules.

I steel have 1h20 to watch ...
