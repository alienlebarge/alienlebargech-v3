[Tapestr](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry) has changed the way I consume social media. I love using this app. It's much simpler than having to constantly switch between 4-5 apps. The @Iconfactory@iconfactory.world team has done an excellent job. 

If in the future, there were to be a Mac app or even better, a website that syncs and allows me to view my news feed on a Mac, you can take my money.
