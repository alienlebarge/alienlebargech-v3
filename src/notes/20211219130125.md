A little experiment to see what the differences and similitudes between Arbhar and Beads. (Disclaimer I love them both)

Arbhar and Beads are sampling the same source and both have their own reverb activated. After going each through one side of Lubadh, Arbhar is hard panned left and Beads right.
Metropolix is sequencing Beads on track 1 and Arbhar on track 2.

Melotus Versio is mangling some recording from Radio Music that adds some strange background discourse.
