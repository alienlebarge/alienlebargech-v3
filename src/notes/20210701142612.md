[@paulrobertlloyd](https://micro.blog/paulrobertlloyd) Is there any tutorial or step by step how to install [@indiekit/syndicator-twitter](https://github.com/getindiekit/indiekit/tree/main/packages/syndicator-twitter) ? Based on [the documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20210305042938/https://getindiekit.com/plugins/@indiekit/syndicator-twitter/) and [your settings](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/paulrobertlloyd-indiekit/blob/main/index.js) I tried to install it but without success.
