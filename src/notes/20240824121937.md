I recently started using the [Twos app](https://www.TwosApp.com?code=alienlebarge), which allows you to note down everything - what they call "things." This can include tasks, notes, blogs, recipes, and basically anything you can think of.

You can set reminders, create lists, and more. So far, I'm quite pleased with it.

There are a few features that I'm used to using in [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com) that aren't available in Twos, which could use some improvement. However, it's quite promising overall.

I plan to continue using it for a while longer to see how it goes.

Additionally, the app is quite fun, and I really appreciate the way the two founders communicate with their users.
