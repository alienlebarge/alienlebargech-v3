I love [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com/). It's truly a great tool. However, the task with the most friction is quickly creating a node when you're not at your computer.
It would be fantastic to have a URL that allows creating a new item in a node. Something like https://workflowy.com/#/[nodehash]/new.

How do you quickly add a new item? 

Currently, I use the mobile app and with my "Inbox" bullet among my favorites, there's a button that allows me to add content. But something even faster would be welcome.
