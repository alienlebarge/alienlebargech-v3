When [@busycircuits](https://www.twitter.com/busycircuits) drops a new [deep dive video](https://youtu.be/ZSUvQq9qs64) about the [Squid Salmple](https://busycircuits.com/alm022/), you watch it and realize again that this module is a real powerhouse.

Here, I explore one of the techniques presented in the video. The [BIA](https://www.noiseengineering.us/shop/basimilus-iteritas-alter) is love sampled and played three times in scale. A lot of randomisation is added to make the sequence evolve freely.
