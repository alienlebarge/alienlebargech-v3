Yesterday, I finished my first [Adventure Lab](https://adventure.geocaching.com/).
The idea is genuinely fun. It's a treasure hunt. You have a series of places to find. Once you've found a place, you need to answer a question about it before moving on to the next. 
In my case, it let me learn some history about [the fountains in Moudon](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC9EFEZ).
