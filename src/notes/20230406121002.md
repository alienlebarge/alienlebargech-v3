I was on the fence to buy a [playdat](https://shop.play.date/) because it looks extra cool.
But, it's not cheap. It cost $199 with the cover (and it will increase tomorrow). 

But that's not all. You have to take into account the shipping cost. To ship it to Switzerland, it will cost $60 !
To that you have to add the [customs fees](https://www.post.ch/en/business-solutions/exports-imports-and-customs-clearance/imports/faqs-about-imports-customs-and-vat). 
16CHF + ($199 + $60) * 3% = ~26 CHF

The grand total will be near $300. This the price of a Nintendo Switch OLED.

But it looks cool ...
